    // so one way of dealing with this is moving the return type to a block parameter

    // to do with the return value
    // (another/older way would be to make this class the delegate of the api object
    // and have a delegate method that would get the results (but that would mean
    // we couldn't just use a class method, would actually need to alloc&init a FlickrAPI object
